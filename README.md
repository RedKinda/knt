# The New and Improved K&T System

## Setup
### Backend:
1. Navigate to ``/knt-backend-go``
2. Run the start script ``./start-backend.sh``
### Frontend:
1. Navigate to ``/knt-front-new`` and run ``npm install``
2. Run ``npm run serve``

**Notes**
Make sure that npm and go are installed, for the latter it can be easily done with snap.

Fronend is currently running on Vue.js 3 with Typescript.
